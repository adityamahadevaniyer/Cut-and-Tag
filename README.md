# Cut-and-Tag Data analysis

I had performed bulk Cut-and-Tag experiments with H3K4me3 histone mark antibodies in mouse germ cells and FACS-sorted HSPCs. These are the scripts for general Cut&Tag data analysis. We already have ChIP-seq datasets generated in these cell types for comparisons. We fine-tuned peak-calling parameters to see which parameter led to better overlap of Cut-and-Tag data with the published ChIP-seq datasets.
